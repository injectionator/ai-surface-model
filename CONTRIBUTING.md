# Contributing

The model is an early draft. Concrete cases and counterexamples are particularly
useful: what does the Surface contain, what is known, and what question should
someone be able to answer from its saved description?

Open an issue for a use case, modeling question, interoperability finding or
proposal. Pull requests should explain the problem, the proposed semantics and
what information remains unknown.

## Issue, branch and pull request workflow

Use one primary issue, a dedicated branch such as `docs/123-model-links`, and one
matching draft PR for each delivery task. Work in the existing checkout and
preserve unrelated changes. Link the PR with `Closes #123`, record the relevant
checks, and keep it draft until review readiness is approved. Merge, release and
deployment are separate decisions.

The [Git workflow in AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#git-workflow) gives the full branch,
workspace and publication rules, including the prohibition on Git worktrees.

## Contribution principles

- Keep partial descriptions useful. Do not require unrelated detail for a task.
- Preserve the distinction between declared configuration and observed behavior.
- Retain identities, sources, time and uncertainty where relevant.
- Prefer existing standard meanings when they fit; explain mapping losses.
- Label examples as synthetic or identify their permitted evidence sources.
- Include only material you have the right to publish; use placeholders for
  credentials and synthetic configuration in public examples.
- Distinguish proposals from released capabilities and verified interoperability.

## Licensing

Contributions use the licence appropriate to their material type:
Apache-2.0 for model assets and software, CC-BY-4.0 for written material.
See [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md). Contributors retain copyright and must have
the right to contribute the material under those terms. Identify any third-party
material and its licence explicitly.

There is no released conformance suite yet. For the current draft, check that
JSON examples parse, their local references resolve, Markdown links work and
the documentation does not claim unimplemented capabilities.
